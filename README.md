Research project undertaken as part of coursework focused on Machine Learning in security. The project aimed to test the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for generating attack traffic to balance datasets in the domain of IoT. It utilized a hybrid ML model, specifically focusing on improving anomaly detection through unsupervised learning to reduce the false positive rates it generated.
